        <p>Why does canvas use TypedArray for image data ? doesn't JavaScript already have an Array?</p>
<h2>Regular Array is an oven sheet</h2>
<p><img src=" oven" width="80%"><em>it can hold various shapes and sizes. (Photo by</em></p>
<h2>TypedArray is muffin tin</h2>
<p><img src=" muffin" width="80%"><em>Optimized for specific shape and size. (Photo by</em></p>
<h3>Note on &quot;Clamped&quot;</h3>
<p>So we now know TypedArray has specific size each element can hold, but what if we assigned value of more than its size? What happens if we put too much batter in each muffin tin?
Not clamped array takes care of this situation by only talking over flow. So if you try to assign 280 into an element in Unit8Array, it will only assign 24 (280 - 256 = 24).</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
</code></pre>
<p>&quot;Clamped&quot; array takes care of this situation differently. Let's think about a case when we changed value of red. If the original color already had value of 255 and we added 30, it will try to assign 285 in our image data array. If this array was using Unit8Array then it will only take over flow which is 29. We'll end up in much dark red even though we wanted to brighten it. In color value, lowest is always 0 and highest is always 255. Clamped Array is designed to take care of there situation by alway choosing clossed value to the size.</p>
<p><img src=" anatomy of typed array" width="80%"></p>
<p>Now we know how to get data from original image, edit color of each pixel, and re-draw edited image. Next let's look into different method to process image like gray scale.</p>
